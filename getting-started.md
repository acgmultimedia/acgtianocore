If you want to compile firmware or utilities, we recommend the [Getting Started]() page. This provides an overview of downloading [EDK II from github](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2) building a sample platform ([NT32]({{wiki}}/Nt32Pkg), [OVMF]({{wiki}}/OVMF), [MdePkg]({{wiki}}/MdePkg), ...). You can also use the latest stable [UDK]({{wiki}}/UDK) snapshot of the EDK II project.

There are multiple [hardware platforms]({{wiki}}/EDK-II-Platforms) using EDK II open source UEFI firmware, including [MinnowBoard Max/Turbot]({{wiki}}/MinnowBoardMax), [MinnowBoard 3]({{wiki}}/MinnowBoard-3), and [IntelÂ® Galileo Gen 2]({{wiki}}/Galileo). This allows you to experiment and develop UEFI features on real hardware.

TianoCore uses Bugzilla to track issues and feature requests. Please review [Reporting Issues]({{wiki}}/Reporting-Issues) and [Reporting Security Issues]({{wiki}}/Reporting-Security-Issues) for more information. If you would like to contribute code or fix issues, please see [How To Contribute]({{wiki}}/How-To-Contribute). The [Tasks]({{wiki}}/Tasks) page has a list of projects that need attention.
