Our community enables [UEFI](https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/UEFI) firmware and tools through various open source projects. Most of our efforts are currently related to the [EDK II]({{baseurl}}/edk2/) project, so if you are developer, then this is a good place to start contributing to our community.

UEFI developers are the primary focus of our community, but if you are interested in trying to use UEFI, then we have a page on how to [start using UEFI](https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Start-using-UEFI).
	
There are several ways to participate in our community. Anyone can join our [Mailing Lists](https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Mailing-Lists) to discuss UEFI related topics.
