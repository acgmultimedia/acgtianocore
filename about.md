Welcome to Tianocore, the community supporting an open source implementation of [UEFI]({{wiki}}/UEFI). [EDK II]({{wiki}}/EDK-II) is a modern, feature-rich, cross-platform firmware development environment for the UEFI and [PI]({{wiki}}/PI) specifications. We hope that you’ll review our [documentation]({{baseurl}}/docs), use Tianocore for [platform firmware]({{wiki}}/EDK-II-Platforms), [report any issues]({{wiki}}/Reporting-Issues) you find, and [contribute to the community]({{wiki}}/How-To-Contribute).

## Downloads
If you want to compile firmware or utilities, we recommend the [Getting Started with EDK II]({{wiki}}/Getting-Started-with-EDK-II) page. This provides an overview of downloading [EDK II from github](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2) and building a sample platform ([NT32]({{wiki}}/Nt32Pkg), [OVMF]({{wiki}}/OVMF), [MdePkg]({{wiki}}/MdePkg), ...). You can also use a UEFI Development Kit ([UDK]({{wiki}}/UDK)) release, which is a stable snapshot based on [EDK II]({{wiki}}/EDK-II).
	
There are multiple [hardware platforms]({{wiki}}/EDK-II-Platforms) using EDK II open source UEFI firmware, including [MinnowBoard Max/Turbot]({{wiki}}/MinnowBoardMax), [MinnowBoard 3]({{wiki}}/MinnowBoard-3), and [Intel® Galileo Gen 2]({{wiki}}/Galileo). This allows you to experiment and develop UEFI features on real hardware.
